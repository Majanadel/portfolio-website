      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>Usability testing was conducted by Maja Nadel, UX Designer and researcher, collaborating with members of the JSI Knowledge Management team. Testing was performed remotely from January 31st, 2022, to February 11th, 2022. The main objectives
        of the test were to assess the overall usability of RHNTC interface design and information architecture, identify the pain points, and outline opportunities to create a more seamless user experience. This was the first-time usability testing
        was performed on the redesigned RHNTC website released in May 2021. 
Considering the current state of the global pandemic, we did all the usability testing interviews remotely. JSI team recruited 11 participants for individual testing; 6 were Title X grantees/subrecipients, and 5 were TPP
        grantees/sub-recipients. The sessions comprised a short pre-test questionnaire, three short tasks, 6-7 scenario tasks tailored to specific OPA grantee groups – Title X or TPP, and a post-test questionnaire that lasted approximately 45 minutes
        each. 
After the pilot test with members of the JSI team and the first round of the interviews, we made numerous changes to scenario tasks that made the test more effective. 
The study uncovered seven significant findings, primarily related to the functionality of the search feature, filtering search results, identifying relevant material, finding help on the website, training lists usage, location, and the
        presentation of information. 
This report summarizes qualitative and quantitative data and outlines the tasks used during the sessions, participant feedback, task completion rates, time on task, usability findings, and recommendations for improvements.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <h3>Characterizing Users & Recruitment</h3>
      <p>RHNTC has a broad range of users, and for this test, we did not require a detailed screening process. The single requirement to participate in this study was that the participants are either Title X or TPP grantees or subrecipients. They
        ranged in age, occupation, and website activity but shared connection to OPA. Participants were recruited through the email that JSI Knowledge Team sent. JSI offered a nominal gift certificate to all selected participants to encourage
        participation. Participants who agreed to participate in our testing received all the testing details beforehand to be ready for on the day of actual testing. There were eleven participants in total.</p>
      <h3>Participant’s Profiles</h3>
      <p>From the data gathered, we discerned that our pool of testers had 6 (54.5%) users associated with the Title X program and five users related to the TPP program (45.5%); users in different age ranges, the majority between 45 – 55 years of age
        (36.4%), following by users 25 – 35 years of age (27.3%), 35 – 45 years (18.2%) and 55 – 65 years (18.2%). Furthermore, all the participants were women (100%). In addition, some participants had a lot of experience with the website (63.6%),
        some were mid-level experienced (9.1%), and users who had never used rhntc.org before (27.3%).</p>

      <h3>Testing Materials</h3>
      <p>Before testing, we created a set of materials to ensure that we collected the correct data and to ensure that team ethically conducted this testing. Each participant received an email containing detailed information about the testing and a
        copy of the Consent form that will allow us to record the session and use the recording to gather the insights from the testing. In addition, to ensure confident facilitation of the interview session, we created a script for the moderator.
        The script provides that the moderator says the same thing to each participant throughout the testing session. The script included a transparent explanation of the study’s intentions, detailed procedural intentions, described thinking aloud,
        task details, and a participant debrief.</p>
      <h3>Tasks</h3>
      <p>The remote usability tests were oriented around a series of questionnaires and tasks. The tasks were intended to replicate common scenarios a user would encounter while navigating the RHNTC website while touching on significant concerns that
        our team recorded from some user feedback on the website. All the users started with a pre-test questionnaire which included some of the background questions, and then we continued with three short tasks. As this testing involved two
        different groups of users – Title X and TPP grantees and subrecipients – we had to adjust the main scenario tasks dependent on the group, to capture the needs of these users. Finally, at the end of the testing, we conducted a short post-test
        questionnaire to determine what users thought about this testing, the website, and how they rated the overall website's usability. </p>
      <h3>Pre-Test and Post-Test Questionnaire </h3>
      <p>Before we started with the main part of our testing, we asked a few questions to our participants to find out some general user characteristics that we didn't collect during the recruitment process. The post-Test questionnaire came after the
        user completed all the scenario tasks. This part was primarily focused on the general experiential feedback. All the questions were open-ended.</p>

      <h2>Analyze</h2>
      <p>Once we finished usability testing sessions, it was time to evaluate the findings by extracting the data from the qualitative data, transcripts, and observations. Every session was reviewed one by one. I was looking for issues participants
        encountered while on the task, actions they took to solve the problem, comments both positive and negative they made during the interview. I added all the observations to Miro whiteboards and Rainbow Spreadsheet, where I was able to record
        behavioral patterns presented by research participants.

        Every time a participant would exhibit a new note-worthy behavior, I wrote the observation in the left-most column of the rainbow sheet. Each participant was assigned a color and a label (I used the labels P1 to P11, which stand for
        participants 1 to 11). If a participant would perform a recorded behavior (or observation), the participant's cell was filled in with the participant's assigned color.
        Once I had filled out the rainbow sheet, I was able to quickly scan it to identify the most common behaviors among test participants.</p>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>Several factors may have affected the results of the usability test. It's important to remember that people bring their own experiences and biases into a test without realizing that they might color their impressions. Some of the factors I
        noticed in our usability testing: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The sample size may not be representative of all people that may use the product</li>
        <li>While moderation began with a set agenda, questions and tasks administered varied from participant to participant.</li>
        <li>Human error and misinterpretations of qualitative feedback affected the results to slight but varying degrees.</li>
        <li>A series of common website bugs and errors occurred </li>
      </ul>
